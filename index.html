                <h1>A little bit about me</h1>
                <p>I'm a junior software engineer, transitioning U.S. Army veteran, indie game developer, and freelance AI trainer based out of the Seattle, WA area. I served in the army for just over 6 years as an all source military intelligence analyst, but my passion has always been computer programming and software development. I started self-teaching myself to code around the same time I joined the army back in 2018, but didn't develop my first serious project until March of 2024 when I participated in my first Game Jam.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The game was rough to say the least. It was a simple 3D third person "horror" game (the scariest thing about it was the litany of game-breaking bugs) but it was satisfying to see a project through to the end. It taught me a lot about managing scope and time to ensure that I could deliver a product that was at least playable. Since then, I've participated in a few more game jams, and have started working on a few more serious projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Feel free to peruse my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on, and if you're interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me via the contact information on the right side of the screen.</p>
