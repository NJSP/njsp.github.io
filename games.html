                    <dd>This is a short horror game I made for the Scream Secrets Game Jam 2024.
        I made this game in about 6 days and had a lot of fun! 
        The theme was "It was here all along."
        The game plays as a text-based RPG within a 3D Horror game. I think the hardest part
        was learning how to create the widget component and then capture the view target and
        use that as a texture for the dynamic material of the computer screen.
        <em>(NOTE: This game is currently in active development and is being updated with 
        new content and bug fixes on a regular basis.)</em></dd>

                    <dd>This was my first ever completed game I submitted for the 
        Goedware zeroUI Game Jam 2024. I made this game in about 7 days.
        The theme was "Light and Darkness."
        Honestly it's a terrible buggy mess that doesn't offer much in the 
        way of entertainment value, but it was a fun (and stressful) experience.
        I think the hardest part of this one was learning how to transfer 
        possession between the different characters.</dd>
